<h1>Rendering</h1>


<p>
Rendering an action is simple. It is nothing more that a series of <span class="code">echo</span> commands, inside the overridden <span class="code">Render</span> method.
</p>

<p class="code">
class ActionViewBook extends Action {
	...
	public function Render(){

		echo '&lt;h2&gt;' . new Html($this->book->Title) . '&lt;/h2&gt;';
		...

	}
	...
}
</p>


<h2>Rendering forms</h2>

<p>
A form in Oxygen always posts its contents back to the same action. Therefore, rendering the form and handing its submissions should be done inside the same <span class="code">Render</span>
method. In fact, handling the form should be done just before the rendering. If there is a validation error, then the code will continue to rendering the form again along with the validation
messages.
</p>

<p class="code">
class ActionViewBook extends Action {
	...
	public function Render(){

		if ($this->IsPostback()) {  // this will check that this is a POST HTTP request coming from the same action.

			// form handling here (validation and processing)

			if ($everything_ok) {

				// success message here maybe ?

				<b>return;</b>
			}
		}


		echo $this->GetForm();  // this will render the HTML form element with the correct action attribute

		// form rendering here, along with any possible validation message generated above

		echo $this->EndForm();

	}
	...
}
</p>



<h2>Messages and Validators</h2>

<p>
A <span class="code">Message</span> is a text that should be displayed to the user, which is classified according to its importance. The importance of the message is defined only by how the
used can respond to the message. There are 6 such levels.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="code">InfoMessage</span> is just a piece of information that the user does not request anything from the user. The user may or may not read the message and continue his or her
work. This is the lowest level.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="code">SuccessMessage</span> is similar to the above because is just a piece of information. However, it is more important, because it gives the user the signal to continue his
work.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="code">WarningMessage</span> is a message that should be read by the user because it <i>may</i> affect its work. However, it is not blocking, and can be ignored.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="code">QuestionMessage</span> is a message where the user has to respond to a question. It is blocking, because the user is obligated to respond to the question before continuing.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="code">ErrorMessage</span> is a blocking message that the user cannot do anything to continue. He has to find another way around it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the <span class="code">BugMessage</span> is a blocking message that the user cannot even find a way around it because everything he did was correct, but there is some error in the code.
This should never happen in a production environment (but it always does, doesn't it).
</p>

<p>
The <span class="code">MessageControl</span> is a control that displays the message in a nice HTML box. The box will have an icon indicating the message severity, which also defines the color
of the background and of the border.
</p>

<p class="code">
$m = new QuestionMessage( new Lemma('en','Are you sure you want to delete this book?') );
echo new MessageControl( $m );
</p>

<p>
In addition, there is the <span class="code">MultiMessage</span>, which message consisting of other messages. The severity of a <span class="code">MultiMessage</span> is equal to the one of the
most severe of its messages. For example, a message consisting of one info message, two warnings and one error is as severe as an error message. In this case, the <span class="code">MessageControl</span>
will display all messages with their icons inside one big box. The color of the background and of the border is determined by the most severe message.
</p>

<p class="code">
$m = new MultiMessage();
$m[] = new InfoMessage( new Lemma('en','The book has 132 pages.') );
$m[] = new WarningMessage( new Lemma('en','Please use capital letters for the author.') );
$m[] = new ErrorMessage( new Lemma('en','The author of the book was not found in the database.') );
echo new MessageControl( $m );
</p>

<p>
A <span class="code">Validator</span> is also a <span class="code">MultiMessage</span>, that comes with additional helping methods. The <span class="code">HasPassed</span> method returns true
if all the messages in the validator are either <span class="code">InfoMessage</span> or <span class="code">SuccessMessage</span>.
</p>

<p class="code">
$v = new Validator();

if (empty($book->Title))
	$v[] = new WarningMessage( new Lemma('en','The title is a mandatory field.') );

if ($v->HasPassed){
	$book->Save();
	return;
}
</p>

<p>
The <span class="code">Validator</span> has several methods to aumatically check a condition and add a message, such as <span class="code">Check</span>, <span class="code">CheckMandatory</span>
of <span class="code">CheckEmail</span>.
</p>

<p class="code">
$v_title = new Validator();
$v_author = new Validator();

$v_title->CheckMandatory( $book->Title );
$v_author->CheckMandatory( $book->Author );
$v_author->Check($book->Author==strtoupper($book->Author), new WarningMessage(new Lemma('en','Please use capital letters for the author.'));

if ($v_title->HasPassed() && $v_author->HasPassed()) {
	$book->Save();
	return;
}
</p>

<p>
Finally, the <span class="code">ValidatorSet</span> is an array of validators, which is useful to group together all the validators of a form. It will automatically create validator objects
as needed.
</p>


<p class="code">
$v = new ValidatorSet();

$v->Title->CheckMandatory( $book->Title );
$v->Author->CheckMandatory( $book->Author );
$v->Author->Check($book->Author==strtoupper($book->Author), new WarningMessage(new Lemma('en','Please use capital letters for the author.'));

if ($v->HasPassed()) {
	$book->Save();
	return;
}
</p>


<h2>A complete typical form action example</h2>

<p>
This is a typical edit form for a book. It is wrapped inside an AJAX dialog and it contains the form itself and the validation. This example will be refactored in the chapter on
<a href="binding.html">Binding</a> to automatically fill and read the form, so it should be considered only as an intermediate step.
</p>

<p class="code">
class ActionModifyBook extends Action {
	public function GetDefaultMode(){ return self::AJAX_DIALOG; }

	/** @var Book */
	private $book;
	public function __construct(Book $book){ parent::__construct(); $this->book = $book; }
	public function GetUrlArgs(){ return array('id'=>$this->book) + parent::GetUrlArgs(); }
	public static function Make(){ return new static(Book::Pick(Http::$GET['id']->AsID())); }

	public function IsPermitted(){ return true; }

	public function Render(){
		$v = new ValidatorSet();
		$m = Book::Meta();

		if ($this->IsPostback()){
			// Read the form
			$this->book->Title = Http::$POST['title']->AsString();
			$this->book->Author = Http::$POST['author']->AsString();

			// Validate the form
			$v->Title->CheckMandatory( $this->book->Title );
			$v->Author->CheckMandatory( $this->book->Author );
			$v->Author->Check($this->book->Author==strtoupper($this->book->Author), Lemma::Retrieve('MsgUseCapitalLetters'));

			// Process the form
			if ($v->HasPassed()) {
				$this->book->Save();
				Oxygen::Refresh();
			}
		}

		// Render the form
		echo $this->GetForm();

		echo $m->Title->GetLabel();
		echo '&lt;br/&gt;'
		TextboxControl::Make( 'title', $this->book->Title )->Render();
		if (!$v->Title->HasPassed()) echo new MessageControl($v->Title);
		echo '&lt;br/&gt;'

		echo $m->Author->GetLabel();
		echo '&lt;br/&gt;'
		TextboxControl::Make( 'author', $this->book->Author )->Render();;
		if (!$v->Author->HasPassed()) echo new MessageControl($v->Author);
		echo '&lt;br/&gt;'

		ButtonControl::Make()->WithValue( Lemma::Retrieve('OK') )->WithIsSubmit( true )->Render();
		ButtonControl::Make()->WithValue( Lemma::Retrieve('Cancel') )->WithIsCancel( true )->Render();
		echo $this->EndForm();
	}
}
