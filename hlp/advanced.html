<h1>Advanced patterns</h1>

<p>
In object oriented programming, there are three patterns which are
fundamental. These are the inheritance (Is-A), the aggregation (Has-A)
and the composition (Consists-Of). These patterns can be mapped
to a relational database.
</p>

<p>
In UML class diagrams (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram"
>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram</a>), inheritance is represented with
an empty triangle arrow, aggregation with an empty diamond arrow and composition with
a filled diamond arrow.
</p>


<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>
In inheritance (Is-A), a base class that has some fields is extended by
one or more other classes which add to those fields.
</p>

<p>
In the following example the class Publication is extended by the class Book and the
class Magazine. The field Title is common to all classes. However, the field Author is
unique to a Book while the field Issue is unique to a Magazine.
</p>

<p class="code">
abstract class Publication extends XItem {
	public $Title;
}
class Book extends Publication {
	public $Author;
}
class Magazine extends Publication {
	public $Issue;
}
</p>

<p>
A simple way to map this pattern into a database is to create three tables, one for
each class. Each table will have a primary key and there will be a one-to-one relation
between the table of the base class and the tables of the extended classes.
</p>

<p class="ascii">
publication          book                 magazine
-------------------  -------------------  -------------------
id                   id                   id
Title                Author               Issue
</p>

<p>
With this setup, each book and each magazine will have a row in the table of publications.
As the table of publications contain both the books and the magazines, the id of a publication
will be unique among all publications. In other words, it is not possible for a book to have
an id equal to an id of a magazine.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, given a book's id, we can find both the author from the table book and the Title
from the table publication. However, given the id of a publication, it is not possible to
find all the fields because we do not know the type. For this reason, we should add another
column to the table of publications.
</p>

<p class="ascii">
publication
-------------------
id
ClassName   -- this field tell us the concrete type of the publication
Title
</p>

<p>
This pattern can be easily mapped with Oxygen, with the following code:
</p>

<p class="code">
abstract class Publication extends XItem {
	public $Title;
	public static function FillMeta(XMeta $m){
		$m->SetDBTableName('publication');
		$m->SetAbstractDBFieldName('ClassName');
		$m->Title = XMeta::String();
	}
}
class Book extends Publication {
	public $Author;
	public static function FillMeta(XMeta $m){
		$m->SetParent(Publication::Meta());
		$m->SetDBTableName('book');
		$m->Author = XMeta::String();
	}
}
class Magazine extends Publication {
	public $Issue;
	public static function FillMeta(XMeta $m){
		$m->SetParent(Publication::Meta());
		$m->SetDBTableName('magazine');
		$m->Issue = XMeta::Integer();
	}
}
</p>


<p>
Now, it is possible to load and save books and magazines directly.
</p>

<p class="code">

// Pick a book. This will load data from both publication and book tables.
$book = Book::Pick( 3 );

// Pick a publication. This will first check the abstract field to find the
// type of the publication and then will load the data from the appropriate
// tables.
$pub = Publication::Pick( 3 );


// Save a book. This will save the data into both tables.
$book->Save();
</p>



<h2>Aggregation</h2>

<p>
In aggregation one object points to another. In reverse, an object can be pointed by
many objects. This is very similar to the concept of relational foreign keys and, as such,
there is no need for special mapping. However, one can add specially tailored methods in
order to provide shortcuts to using aggregation.
</p>

<p class="code">
class Book extends XItem {
	public $idAuthor;
	...
	/**
	 * Shortcut to the author
	 * @return Author
	 */
	public function GetAuthor(){
		return Author::Pick( $this->idAuthor );
	}
}
class Author extends XItem {
	...
	/**
	 * Inverse shortcut to the books
	 * @return XList
	 */
	public function GetBooks(){
		return Book::Seek()->Where( Book::Meta()->idAuthor->Eq( $this ) );
	}
}
</p>



<h2>Composition</h2>

<p>
Composition is a stronger form of aggregation. For example we say that a book
"Has-An" author (aggregation) or that the author "Has-Many" books (aggregation).
However we also say that a book "Consists-Of" chapters (composition) or that
a chapter "Belongs-To" a book (composition). In contrast to an author, a chapter
of a book is not a stand-alone object. In addition, the chapter always belongs to
one book; should the book be deleted, the chapter should be deleted as well.
</p>

<p>
In Object-Relational mapping, it is important that an object is mapped as a whole.
If an object consists of many other sub-objects, it would be nice to be able to
load all of them or save them back in one step.
</p>

<p>
In order to do this, we introduce the concept of slave objects which are mapped
by slave fields.
</p>

<p class="code">
class Book extends XItem {
	public $Chapters;
	public static function FillMeta(XMeta $m){
		...
		$m->Chapters = BookChapter::Meta()->idBook->Slave();
	}
}

class BookChapter extends XItem {
	public $idBook;
	public static function FillMeta(XMeta $m){
		...
		$m->idBook = XMeta::ID();
	}
}
</p>
